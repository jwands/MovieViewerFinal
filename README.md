# MovieViewerFinal
 Project 1 - *Movie Viewer*

**Movie Viewer** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [*] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [*] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [*] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [*] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Trouble-shooting
2. Possible errors (particularly receiving the expectation error)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

For some reason, I have to click on the name of the movie to get it to appear. I checked and I didn't have any additional labels in the table view so I'm not sure why this is occuring.
I downloaded and added the loading pod, but I'm not sure exactly how to make it appear.
Also, I was a bit confused by some of the directions
